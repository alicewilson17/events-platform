## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **PostgreSQL** for local development

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alicewilson17/events-platform.git
   cd events-platform
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:** Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend.

```
# For the backend
cd backend
npm install

# For the frontend
cd ../frontend/events-platform-frontend
npm install
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

To run this project locally, you will need to create two environment files in the backend directory, `.env.development` and `.env.test`, to store your environment-specific configurations.

1. **.env.development** - Used for local development.
   ```
   PGDATABASE=events_platform
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here 
   ```

**2. .env.test** - Used for testing environments.
```
PGDATABASE=events_platform_test
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
```
Ensure that each environment file includes the PGDATABASE for the appropriate database and a JWT_SECRET (which should be set to a unique, random string) for token signing and verification.

Note: Remember to add these files to your .gitignore to keep your environment configurations private and secure. 

You will also need to create a .env file in the frontend/events-platform-frontend directory, containing the following:

```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:9090/api
```

4. Set Up the Database: Ensure PostgreSQL is running locally, and set up the required database and tables, by running the following command:

```
npm run setub-dbs
```

Seed the development database by running the following command:

```
npm run seed
```

## Running Tests
This project was created according to Test Driven Development practices. The test suite can be found in the __tests__/auth.test.js directory.

To run the test suite for the api, run the following command:
```
npm test
```
The test suite uses the data from the test database. The test suite is set up such that the test database will be re-seeded before each test is run, to ensure that the outcome of a given test is not affected by any of the previous tests.

## Running the Application
**Start the Backend Server:** Open a terminal in the backend folder and start the server.
```
cd backend
npm start
```
The server should now be running on http://localhost:9090.

**Start the Frontend Development Server:** Open a terminal in the frontend/events-platform-frontend folder and start the React development server.
```
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

## Future Improvements
- Admin-only endpoint: update event
- Admin-only enpoint: delete event
- Stripe for secure payment
- Allow sorting and filtering of events
